Hi! I'm Ashraful Islam, a Computer Science graduate from North South University, with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Databases, and Problem Solving. I'm currently focused on deepening my knowledge in Machine Learning, Data Science, and writing Clean Code. One of my key projects involves building a Machine Learning-based Crop Recommendation System to support smarter agricultural practices. During my undergrad, I especially enjoyed courses like Database Management (CSE311), Software Engineering (CSE327), and CSE440, which helped me build a solid foundation in both theory and application. My long-term goal is to become a Lecturer at North South University, where I hope to inspire and guide future students. I'm always open to collaborating on meaningful tech projects. Feel free to reach out at aiashraful09@gmail.com
